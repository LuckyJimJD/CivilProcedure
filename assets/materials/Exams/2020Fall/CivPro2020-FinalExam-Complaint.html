<h2 id="the-parties">The Parties</h2>

  <li>Plaintiff Harold Richman is an individual residing in California. He purchased goods and services from the Defendant, namely burial plots with planting and maintenance of English Ivy ground covering, for his deceased parents.</li>
  <li>Defendant Whispering Glades, Inc. is a business corporation, incorporated and having its principal place of business in Susquehanna. Defendant owns and operates Whispering Glades Cemetery in Gritty City.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="jurisdiction-and-venue">Jurisdiction and Venue</h2>

<ol>
  <li>This court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims herein under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, because Plaintiff and Defendant are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy between Plaintiff and Defendant, without interest and costs, exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.</li>
  <li>Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1331(b)(2), because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="factual-background">Factual Background</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Plaintiff’s parents, Marvin and Shirley Richman, shared a devotion to English Ivy. They were active members of the Susquehanna State Chapter of the English Ivy Fanciers Association, earned numerous prizes for the English Ivy garden at their Gritty City home, and were internationally recognized as leading authorities on the history and cultivation of English Ivy. Countless times over the years, Plaintiff’s parents reminded him of their wish to “spend eternity under the ivy that we love so dearly.”</li>
  <li>In October 2010, Plaintiff’s parents passed away and their remains were interred at Whispering Glades Cemetery.</li>
  <li>Plaintiff purchased the burial plots at Whispering Glades for his parents at a cost of $5000, as part of an Eternal Rest Assured Plan (“the Plan”). The Plan also included a choice of ground cover planting on the gravesites, to be maintained by Whispering Glades for an additional annual fee of $100. At the time of purchase, Plaintiff selected English Ivy as the ground covering, stressing that this was his parents’ express desire.</li>
  <li>Plaintiff has paid the annual $100 maintenance fee each year since 2010.</li>
  <li>In October 2020, the tenth anniversary of his parent’s passing, Plaintiff visited Whispering Glades Cemetery to pay his respects. Plaintiff was shocked and horrified to discover that there was no ivy growing on his parents’ gravesites.</li>
  <li>On information and belief, despite Plaintiff’s payment of the annual maintenance fee, Whispering Glades, unilaterally, without justification or excuse, and without notice to Plaintiff, removed the ivy ground covering from his parents’ gravesites in or around October 2015 and has never replaced it since.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="count-i">Count I</h2>
<h2 id="violation-of-the-susquehanna-unfair-trade-practices-act">Violation of the Susquehanna Unfair Trade Practices Act</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.</li>
  <li>Defendant advertised goods and services under the Eternal Rest Assured Plan with intent not to sell them as advertised.</li>
  <li>As a result of Defendant’s unfair and deceptive acts and practices, Plaintiff has suffered monetary loss in the amount of $500, representing the annual maintenance fees that Plaintiff has paid since October 2015, when Defendant removed the ivy ground covering from his parents’ gravesites.</li>
  <li>As a further result of Defendant’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiff has suffered severe mental and emotional distress over the betrayal of his parents’ wish to be buried beneath the English Ivy that they so dearly loved.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="request-for-relief">Request For Relief</h2>

<p>Wherefore, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter judgment in his favor and award the following relief:</p>

(b) Damages for mental and emotional distress;
(c) Costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by Plaintiff in bringing this action; and 
(d) Such other and further relief as the Court may deem necessary, just, and proper.</p>
