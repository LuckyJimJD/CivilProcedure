<h1 id="facts">Facts</h1>

<p>Tiger Foods is a supermarket chain with stores located in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. The company is organized as a business partnership (unincorporated business) under North Carolina law. The business partners include individuals who reside in North Carolina and South Carolina.</p>

<p>US Broadcasting Corp. (“UBC”) is incorporated in Delaware with its corporate headquarters in New York. UBC produces television programs that air on its national network of stations, including independently-owned affiliates in North and South Carolina. UBC is licensed and regulated under federal law by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>Kari Kaplan (a resident of California) is a producer, and Linda Lewis (a resident of South Carolina) is a reporter, for UBC’s “Evening Exposé” news program, which airs weekly on the UBC network (including the NC and SC affiliates). For a story on unsavory practices in the retail food industry, Kaplan assigned Lewis to go “undercover” at Tiger Foods. Lewis applied for a job and was hired as a deli counter clerk at a South Carolina Tiger Foods store. Using a hidden camera, she secretly videotaped activity at the store. Among other things, the videos showed store managers instructing employees to relabel past-date foods (including spoiled meats and dairy products) and return them to sale displays. Kaplan included some of the videos in the program, along with a voice-over stating that the practice of relabeling and selling past-date and spoiled foods “violates state and federal laws”.</p>

<p>After the Evening Exposé story airs, sales at Tiger Foods stores fall by 25%. Tiger Foods decides to sue UBC, Kaplan, and Lewis for defamation. Defamation is a state common law claim with the following elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The defendant made a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff.</li>
  <li>The defendant published the statement to others.</li>
  <li>The defendant acted at least negligently in publishing the statement.</li>
  <li>The plaintiff suffered damages as a result.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tiger Foods alleges that the video footage shown in the program was either doctored or out of context, and denies that it sold past-date or spoiled foods in violation of any state or federal laws. The company seeks $1 million (the amount of lost sales revenue) in damages  against the three defendants jointly and severally.</p>

<h2 id="question-1">Question 1</h2>

<p>If Tiger Foods files its suit in North Carolina, will the court have personal jurisdiction over all three defendants?</p>

<h2 id="question-2">Question 2</h2>

<p>Regardless of your answer to the previous question, would a federal court have subject matter jurisdiction over the suit?</p>
