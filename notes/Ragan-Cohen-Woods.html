				<h1 class="page-title">Distinguishing "Substantive" and "Procedural" rules under Erie</h1>

<div class="outline">
	<p>In <em>Erie</em>, Justice Reed (concurring in the judgment) observed, “The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy ….” In subsequent cases, the Supreme Court has sought to clarify that line. Making sense of these cases is the key to solving choice of law problems under the <em>Erie</em> doctrine.</p>

<p>In <em>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</em>, 326 US 99 (1945), the plaintiffs sued Guaranty Trust for alleged fraud in connection with an offer to purchase bonds that the plaintiffs held in an insolvent corporation. Under state law, a ten-year statute of limitations would apply to the plaintiffs’ claims. The issue was whether the federal court was required to apply the state statute of limitations (in which case the suit would be dismissed as untimely), or could instead follow the federal practice of applying the principle of laches (which, unlike a statute of limitations, does not impose a strict time limit, but instead gives a court more flexibility in deciding whether the plaintiffs waited too long to bring their suit) to “equity” claims like the plaintiffs’.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals held that <em>Erie</em> applied only to state laws governing “substantive rights”, and that federal courts were not required to follow state law when it comes to “equitable ‘remedial rights’”. <em>York v. Guaranty Trust Co.</em>, 143 F. 2d 503 at 523 (2d Cir. 1944). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute of limitations was a “substantive” rule for purposes of the <em>Erie</em> doctrine.</p>

<p>The basis of the Court’s decision was that applying a different rule in federal court than in state court would result in a different outcome on the merits of the case. In state court, the case would be dismissed based on the statute of limitations (which is a decision on the merits, in the sense that it means the plaintiff has no claim for which the court may grant a remedy). In federal court, the case would go forward (i.e. the plaintiff has a chance to win on the merits).</p>

<p>A few years later, the Court decided three cases that have come to be known as the “Ragan/Cohen/Woods Trilogy”:</p>

<p><em>Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co.,</em> 337 US 530 (1949). This was a lawsuit arising out of a traffic accident. The issue was whether the plaintiff had commenced the action within two years of the accident, as required under the applicable statute of limitations. The plaintiff had filed the suit with the court within the two year limitations period, but did not serve it on the defendant until after that period lapsed. Under state law, “An action shall be deemed commenced [for purposes of the statute of limitations] as to each defendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him ….” In contrast, under federal law, specifically FRCP Rule 3, “A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.”</p>

<p><em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>, 337 US 541 (1949). A corporate shareholder sued the directors of the corporation for breach of fiduciary duty (you’ll learn about these suits when you take Business Associations). Under state law, an unsuccessful plaintiff in that type of suit was liable for the defendant’s legal fees and expenses (a provision that the Court regarded as “clearly … substantive”); state law further permitted the defendant to require the plaintiff to post a bond at the outset of the suit, to secure payment of those defense expenses. In contrast, FRCP Rule 23 (now Rule 23.1), appliable to shareholder suits, had no bond requirement.</p>

<p><em>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co.</em>, 337 US 535 (1949). A Tennessee corporation sued a Mississippi resident to collect a commission on a sale of his home. Under state law, an out-of-state corporation “shall not be permitted to bring or maintain any action or suit in any of the courts of this state” unless it designated a registered agent in the state to accept service of process. There was no such requirement under federal law.</p>

<p>In each case, applying the federal rule instead of the state rule would produce a different outcome: The suit would be dismissed under state law, but would not be dismissed under federal law. Requiring federal courts to follow state law in these cases satisfies “the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws” See <em>Hanna v. Plumer</em>, 380 US 460. 468 (1965)</p>

<p>Note that both <em>Ragan</em> and <em>Woods</em> involved a choice between state law and a federal rule under the FRCP. These cases pre-dated <em>Hanna</em>, in which the Court held that federal courts should follow an applicable provision of the FRCP, not a contrary state law, as long as the FRCP rule is “rationally capable of classification as” procedural. <em>Ragan</em> and <em>Woods</em> are examples of cases in which state law and the FRCP are not in direct conflict, because they are about different things (e.g. FRCP Rule 3 simply explains how to initiate a suit in federal court, while state law more specifically governs the tolling of the statute of limitations). Consequently, the <em>Hanna</em> analysis doesn’t apply and instead the choice of law is governed by <em>Erie</em>. See <em>Walker v. Armco Steel</em>, 446 US 740 (1980) (re-visiting the same issue, and reaching the same conclusion, as in <em>Ragan</em>).</p>
