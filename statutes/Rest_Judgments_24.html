	<h2 id="-24-dimensions-of-claim-for-purposes-of-merger-or-bargeneral-rule-concerning-splitting">§ 24 Dimensions of “Claim” for Purposes of Merger or Bar—General Rule Concerning “Splitting”</h2>

<p>(1) When a valid and final judgment rendered in an action extinguishes the plaintiff’s claim pursuant to the rules of merger or bar (see §§ 18, 19), the claim extinguished includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.</p>

<p>(2) What factual grouping constitutes a “transaction”, and what groupings constitute a “series”, are to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties’ expectations or business understanding or usage.
 
The general rule of this Section is exemplified in § 25, and is subject to the exceptions stated in § 26.</p>

Change of circumstances. Material operative facts occurring after the decision of an action with respect to the same subject matter may in themselves, or taken in conjunction with the antecedent facts, comprise a transaction which may be made the basis of a second action not precluded by the first. See Illustrations 10-12. Where important human values—such as the lawfulness of a continuing personal disability or restraint—are at stake, even a slight change of circumstances may afford a sufficient basis for concluding that a second action may be brought.</h5>

A brings an action against B to set aside a transfer of land on the ground that it was procured by fraud. A fails to prove the fraud and judgment is given for the defendant. A is not precluded from maintaining an action to recover the land on the ground that since judgment was rendered B has forfeited the land to the plaintiff for breach of a condition in the conveyance.</h6>

A judgment of divorce awards custody of a minor child of the marriage to the wife after a contest over her suitability as a mother. Upon a later demonstration by the husband, on the basis of subsequent experience, that the wife is in fact unsuitable, custody may be awarded to the husband.</h6>

The government fails in an action against a defendant under an antitrust statute for lack of adequate proof that the defendant participated in a conspiracy to restrain trade. The government is not precluded from a second action against the same defendant in which it relies on conspiratorial acts post-dating the judgment in the first action, and may rely also on acts preceding the judgment insofar as these lend significance to the later acts.</h6>
