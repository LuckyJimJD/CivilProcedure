<ol>
  <li>
    <p>(Statement of Jurisdiction — See Form 7.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On (DATE), at (PLACE), the defendant negligently drove a motor vehicle against the plaintiff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the plaintiff was physically injured, lost wages or income, suffered physical and mental pain, and incurred medical expenses of $_____.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, the plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant for $_____ , plus costs.</p>

<hr />

<p>Compare code pleading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“In an action or defense based upon negligence, it is not sufficient to allege the mere happening of an event of an injurious nature and call it negligence on the part of the party sough to be charged. This is necessarily so because negligence is not a fact in itself, but is the legal result of certain facts. Therefore, <em>the facts which constitute the negligence charged and also the facts which establish such negligence as the proximate cause, or as one of the proximate causes, of the injury must be alleged</em>.” <em>Gillespie v. Goodyear Svc. Stores,</em> 258 N.C. 487 (1963) (emphasis added), quoting <em>Shives v. Sample,</em> 238 N.C. 724 (1953).

  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="analysis">Analysis</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Court assumes truth of allegations re: common pricing, no geographic competition</li>
  <li>But court treats allegation that defendants acted pursuant to an agreement as conclusory
    <ul>
      <li>Plaintiffs merely recite the element, without alleging facts about agreement</li>
      <li>Why isn’t this sufficient?
        <ul>
          <li>Plaintiffs are relying on parallel conduct to raise an <em>inference</em> of an agreement; the implicit assertion is that the parallel conduct must have resulted from an agreement, rather than independent decisions by each defendant.</li>
          <li>Majority says the inference of an agreement isn’t sufficiently <em>plausible</em> given only parallel conduct.</li>
          <li>Alternative explanation: market efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What more should the plaintiffs have done to satisfy the Court?
    <ul>
      <li>They don’t necessarily have to allege detailed facts about the agreement (who, what, where, when).
        <ul>
          <li>Heightened pleading standard for fraud under Rule 9 doesn’t apply.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>But they must allege enough to suggest that an agreement (as opposed to lawful parallel conduct) is a plausible inference.</li>
      <li>Does that place an unreasonable burden on plaintiffs in cases this this, where the relevant facts aren’t readily observable or disclosed?
        <ul>
          <li>What could the plaintiffs realistically have alleged?</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Burden on defendant in having to answer and defend suits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Are these valid concerns in the context of the FRCP?
    <ul>
      <li>Rule 8(a) is supposed to require only notice of the claim, saving proof for discovery.</li>
      <li>Rule 11 subjects parties to sanctions for alleging facts or asserting claims without a reasonable foundation.</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Factual allegations v. legal conclusions
    <ul>
      <li>Court assumes truth of factual allegations about who was detained and how they were treated.</li>
      <li>But court disregards, as legal conclusion, allegation of discriminatory motive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plausibility of inference
    <ul>
      <li>Absent direct evidence of discriminatory purpose, plaintiffs rely on factual allegations about detention to raise inference.</li>
      <li>Majority: The factual “allegations are consistent with with [defendants] purposefully designating detainees ‘of high interest’ because of their race, religion, or national origin. But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.”</li>
      <li>Majority distinguishes between constitutionality of plaintiff’s <em>arrest</em> and constitutionality of the policy for classifying detainees as “high interest”.
        <ul>
          <li>Plaintiff’s claim against Attorney General &amp; FBI Director went only to the policy, not the arrest itself.</li>
          <li>Allegation that defendants “adopt[ed] a policy approving ‘restrictive conditions of confinement’ for post-Sepember 11 detainees until they were ‘cleard by the FBI’” is insufficient to plausibly support inference that they did so because of detainees’ “race, religion, or national origin.”</li>
          <li>“All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation’s top law enforcement officers … sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure consitions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity.”</li>

<h4 id="zielinski-v-philadelphia-piers-inc-ed-pa-1956">Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers, Inc. (E.D. Pa. 1956)</h4>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Zielinski was injured when he was hit by a fork lift while at work.</li>
  <li>Believing that the fork lift was owned by Philadelphia Piers, Inc. (PPI) and that the fork lift driver was a PPI employee, Zielinski sued PPI for his injury.
    <ul>
      <li>N.B. Workers compensation bars claims by an employee against their employer for injury sustained in the course of employment. But workers compensation does not bar claims for work-related injuries against third-parties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In fact, a year before the accident, PPI had sold its business to another company, Carload Contractors, Inc. (CCI), and the fork lift operator who caused the accident became a CCI employee. PPI continued to own the fork lift and the pier where the accident happened, which it leased to CCI.
    <ul>
      <li>Upon receiving the complaint, PPI notified its insurance carrier, noting that CCI should be the defendant instead of PPI.</li>
      <li>CCI was insured by the same carrier, and had notified the carrier of the accident the day after it occurred.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Zielinski’s complaint included this allegation:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“a motor-driven vehicle known as a fork lift or chisel, owned, operated and controlled by the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, was so negligently and carelessly managed * * * that the same * * * did come into contact with the plaintiff causing him to sustain the injuries more fully hereinafter set forth.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>In its Answer (filed after PPI contacted the insurance company to point out the mistaken identification of the responsible defendant), PPI responded to this paragraph with a general denial, without explaining that it no longer owned the fork lift or employed the operator at the time of the accident.</li>
  <li>PPI also failed to point out the sale of its business in its responses to the plaintiff’s discovery requests.
    <ul>
      <li>The fork lift operator, apparently unaware that his employer had changed, identified himself as an employee of PPI in his deposition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More than two years after the compliant and answer were filed, the plaintiff learned that PPI had sold its business to CCI prior to the accident.</li>
  <li>At some point after filing its Answer (in which it generally denied the allegations including ownership of the fork lift), PPI admitted that it owned the fork lift and the pier, which it least to CCI.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding--analysis">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<ul>
  <li>General denial in Answer was ineffective, where PPI admitted ownership of the fork lift.</li>
  <li>As a result of ineffective denial, and failure to correct it for over two years, PPI is deemed to have admitted <em>both</em> that it owned the fork lift (which was actually true) <em>and</em> that the operator was employed by and working for PPI at the time of the accident (which was not actually true).</li>
  <li>Court assusmed there was no bad faith, but concluded that “principles of equity require that defendant be estopped from denying agency because, otherwise, its inaccurate statements and statements in the record, which it knew (or had the means of knowing within its control) were inaccurate, will have deprived plaintiff of his right of action.”
    <ul>
      <li>If defendant had answered properly, plaintiff could have sued CCI instead.</li>

<p>Party may amend, without consent of opposing party or court, one time</p>

<p>Only allowed one time.</p>

<p>Must be within 21 days of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>service of the pleading to be amended, <em>or</em></li>
  <li>service of a responsive pleading or Rule 12(b)/(e)/(f) motion, if pleading to be amended requires a response</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the time limit for amending under Rule 15(a)(1) depends on whether the pleading to be amended is one that requires a response under the FRCP.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A complaint always requires a response (either an Answer or a Motion under Rule 12)</li>
  <li>An answer does not require a response, unless it also asserts a counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the pleading requires a response, the 21 day clock does not start running until the response is served.</p>

<p><em>Example 1:</em> Plaintiff files &amp; serves a complaint on September 1. Plaintiff may amend the complaint, as a matter of course, at any time before Defendant serves an answer or motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), <em>even if more than 21 days have passed since Plaintiff served the complaint</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note that this use up the one-time amendment as a matter of course, so any further amendment will require either the defendant’s consent or leave of the court.</li>
</ul>

<p>A defendant must normally serve an answer or motion within 21 days from service of the complaint. Rule 12(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>

<ul>
  <li>But if the defendant agrees to waive formal service, the deadline is 60 days (90 days if the defendant is outside the US) after the request for waiver.</li>
  <li>Parties may also agree to additional time.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Example 2:</em> Plaintiff files &amp; serves a complaint on September 1. Defendant files an answer or motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f) on September 5. Plaintiff has until September 26 to amend the complaint as a matter of course.  Rule 15(a)(1)(B).</p>

<p><em>Example 3:</em> Plaintiff files &amp; serves a complaint on September 1. Defendant files an answer or motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f) on September 5. Defendant has until September 26 to amend the complaint as a matter of course. Rule 15(a)(1)(A).</p>

<h5 id="holding--analysis-3">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Rule 11 sanctions were justified on three grounds:
    <ul>
      <li>“[T]he complaint was not well grounded in fact”
        <ul>
          <li>The complaint contained “numerous misstatements of fact” and “allegations which utterly lacked any basis in fact”.</li>
          <li>“While a lawyer may rely on discovery to reveal additional facts to support claims which are well grounded in fact, Rule 11 sanctions are appropriate when a lawyer attempts to use discovery to support outrageous and frivolous claims for which there is no factual support.”</li>
          <li>Rule 11 has been amended, both substantively and stylistically, since this case. Would the outcome be different under the current Rule 11(b)(3): “the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery”?</li>

      </li>
      <li>“[T]he complaint was not well grounded in law”

      </li>
      <li>“[T]he [attorneys’] improper purpose in filing the complaint”
        <ul>
          <li>“[I]f a complaint is filed to vindicate rights in court, and also for some other purpose, a court should not sanction counsel for an intention that the court does not approve, so long as the added purpose is not undertaken in bad faith and is not so excessive as to eliminate a proper purpose.”
            <ul>
              <li>But, “[f]iling of excessive motions may sometimes constitute “harassment” under the rule even if the motions are well grounded.”
 			- “Likewise, filing a motion or pleading without a sincere intent to pursue it will garner sanctions.”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The trial court found that “plaintiffs’ counsel never intended to litigate this § 1983 action and that counsel filed it for publicity, to embarrass state and county officials, to use as leverage in criminal proceedings, to obtain discovery for use in criminal proceedings, and to intimidate those involved in the prosecution of Hatcher and Jacobs.”

  <li>The imposition of additional sanctions of $10,000 against each attorney for their “pains to publicize the allegations through the media” was improper.

<h5 id="defendants-arguments--courts-ruling">Defendant’s Arguments &amp; Court’s Ruling</h5>

<ul>
  <li>No legal basis
    <ul>
      <li>Argument: Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over state law claims
        <ul>
          <li>Court: Based on precedent, plaintiff’s lawyer could reasonably have believed court had subject matter jurisdiction over state law claims</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Argument: Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies
        <ul>
          <li>Court: Plaintiff’s lawyer identified no legal authority to support application of futility exception to administrative exhaustion requirement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Argument: No legal support for claim for breach of duty based on special relationship
        <ul>
          <li>Court: Settled Virginia law established that school district attorney owed no duty to any third party, and plaintiff’s lawyer did not appear to have performed any legal research on the issue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No factual basis
    <ul>
      <li>Argument: Complaint did not offer sufficient factual basis for claims
        <ul>
          <li>Court: Reasonable investigation would have revealed that defendant was not attorney for certain schools districts and was not involved in their actions, contrary to allegations in complaint. Failure to conduct reasonable factual investigation violates Rule 11.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Improper purpose
    <ul>
      <li>Argument: Plaintiff’s “primary motives were to gain publicity, and to embarrass teachers, principals, and state and county officials.” Relies on public statements by plaintiff’s counsel “We took a chance because there was not a lot of case law … but something had to be done to wake up the defendants and get the information out there.”
        <ul>
          <li>Court: No indication that plaintiff never intended to litigate (distinguishing <em>Kunstler</em>). But willful filing of baseless complaint supports inference that suit was improperly filed for a purpose other than to vindicate legal rights.</li>

  <li>Attorney filed Title VII claims on behalf of bakery workers</li>
  <li>Employer argued claims were subject to mandatory arbitration under CBA</li>
  <li>Trial court granted summary judgment and imposed Rule 11 sanctions</li>

<h5 id="issue-1">Issue</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Whether attorney had a good faith argument for challenging the 4th Circuit’s prior decision in <em>Owens-Brockway Glass Container,</em> holding CBA applied to Title VII claims?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="analysis-4">Analysis</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Appellate court review for abuse of discretion</li>
  <li>Purpose of Rule 11 sanctions
    <ul>
      <li>Deter future litigation abuse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="standard-1">Standard</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Claim is frivolous under Rule 11 only where it has “absolutely no chance of success under the existing precedent”
    <ul>
      <li>This was not the case here</li>
      <li>4th Circuit’s decision in <em>Owens-Brockway</em> was contrary to decisions of other circuits to have considered the issue
        <ul>
          <li>N.B. Trial court issued its decision imposing sanctions after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Wright v. Universal Maritime Svcs Corp.</em> (1998), which adopted the position that Hunter advanced in support of her claims.</li>
          <li>But even if the Supreme Court had ultimately decided the issue the other way, the existence of a split among the lower courts would be enough to give plaintiff a good faith argument for their position.</li>

<p>The attorney in this case, Pamela Hunter, was censured by the NC State Bar Grievance Committee in 2010, for her conduct in connection with a medical malpractice case. <em>Matter of Hunter,</em> 10G0295 (2010)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Grievance Committee found that Hunter violated Rule 3.1 by filing the suit with “no factual basis”.</li>
  <li>Hunter also violated Rules 1.4 &amp; 1.8 by dropping the suit and personally paying her client $20,000, without explaining the purpose of the payments to the client, who though the case had settled.</li>
