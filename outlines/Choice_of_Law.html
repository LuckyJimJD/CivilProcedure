<h2 id="the-rules-of-decision-act">The Rules of Decision Act</h2>

<h4 id="28-us-code--1652">28 U.S. Code § 1652</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="legal-naturalism">Legal Naturalism</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; … It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times …</p>

<p>Implications of natural law theory for understanding common law:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The common law is not specific to any time or place; it is uniform &amp; unchanging.</li>
  <li>Differences in common law rules among jurisdictions merely reflect imperfect understanding of the true common law.</li>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Tyson (NY) gave bill of exchange to speculators as payment for land.
    <ul>
      <li>Speculators didn’t really own the land</li>
      <li>Speculators gave Tyson’s bill to Swift to pay off a pre-existing debt.</li>
      <li>Swift had no involvement in nor knowledge of the swindle.</li>
      <li>Swift sought to cash the bill and Tyson refused to pay.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Swift sued Tyson for payment in federal court.
    <ul>
      <li>Swift argued that, as a bona fide holder who took the bill for valuable consideration without notice of the fraud, he was entitled to payment from Tyson.</li>
      <li>Tyson argued that, under NY state court decisions, a pre-existing debt was not valuable consideration for a negotiable instrument.</li>

<h5 id="issue">Issue</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Whether, under the RDA, the federal court was obligated to follow NY state court decisions.</li>

<h5 id="analysis">Analysis</h5>

<ul>
  <li>RDA: “the laws of the several states … shall be … the rules of decision in trials at common law”
    <ul>
      <li>“[I]t will hardly be contended that the decisions of Courts constitute laws. They are, at most, only evidence of what the laws are; and are not of themselves laws.”</li>
      <li>“The laws of a state are more usually understood to mean the rules and enactments promulgated by the legislative authority thereof, or long established local customs having the force of laws.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Where the (unwritten) common law provides the rules of decision, the duty of a federal courts, like any court, is “to ascertain upon general reasoning and legal analogies” the “general principles and doctrines of … jurisprudence”.
    <ul>
      <li>Decisions by state courts offer guidance, “but they cannot furnish positive rules, or conclusive authority, by which our own judgments are to be bound up and governed”.</li>

<h4 id="black--white-taxicab-v-brown--yellow-taxicab-us-1928">Black &amp; White Taxicab v. Brown &amp; Yellow Taxicab (U.S. 1928)</h4>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history-1">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Brown &amp; &amp; Yellow Taxicab (B&amp;Y, a KY corp.) and the Louisville &amp; Nashville RR (L&amp;N, a KY corp.) wanted to enter contract giving B&amp;Y exclusive rights to L&amp;N’s Bowling Green, KY, station.
    <ul>
      <li>The agreement would prevent Black &amp; White Taxicab (B&amp;W), a competitor of B&amp;Y, from picking up and dropping off passengers at that station.</li>
      <li>Agreement would be void under prior KY state court decisions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All three companies were incorporated in KY and were thus citizens of that state.
    <ul>
      <li>At this time, only the state of incorporation counted for citizenship of a corporation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>B&amp;Y reincorporated in TN, then executed the contract with L&amp;N in TN.</li>
  <li>B&amp;Y (TN) then filed a suit in KY federal court against B&amp;W (KY) and L&amp;N (KY), seeking an injunction prohibiting B&amp;W from interfering with contract between B&amp;Y and L&amp;N.
    <ul>
      <li>By changing its state of incorporation from KY to TN, B&amp;Y created diversity of citizenship, allowing it to sue in federal court instead of state court.</li>
      <li>It was necessary to include L&amp;N in the lawsuit, since it was a party to the contract with B&amp;Y.</li>
      <li>L&amp;N was included as a defendant, rather than as a co-plaintiff, to preserve diversity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Federal trial court declined to follow KY state court decisions, and determined that the contract was lawful under “general” common law.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding-1">Holding</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Following <em>Swift v. Tyson,</em> the Supreme Court held that the federal trial court properly applied “general common law” rather than following KY state court decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="significance">Significance</h5>

<p><em>Black &amp; White Taxi</em> illustrates the problem with the <em>Swift</em> approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assume B&amp;W (KY corp.) sued to challenge the contract:
    <ul>
      <li>B&amp;Y (TN) and L&amp;N (KY) would have to be joined as co-defendants.</li>
      <li>Since B&amp;W and L&amp;N are both KY citizens, the federal court would not have diversity jurisdiction.</li>
      <li>The KY state court would apply KY law and declare the contract void.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now assume that the contract would be valid under KY law, but that a federal court applying “general law” would declare the contract void (i.e. the reverse of the actual case):
    <ul>
      <li>If B&amp;Y (TN) sues B&amp;W (KY) and L&amp;N (KY) in KY state court to enforce the contract, may B&amp;W remove to take advantage of more favorable federal law?</li>
      <li>There is complete diversity</li>
      <li>But forum defendant rule would prevent removal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Under each scenario (i.e. the actual <em>Black &amp; White Taxi</em> case and the two hypothetical versions), the outcome will be different in state v. federal court. This makes law both unpredictable &amp; inequitable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parties can’t be sure what their legal rights and duties are until they end up in one court or the other.</li>
  <li>Some parties will be able to forum shop for more favorable law, but others won’t (because of the limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction).
    <ul>
      <li>At the time of <em>Black &amp; White Taxi,</em> the citizenship of a corporation for diversity purposes was based only on its state of incorporation. The plaintiff corporation, Brown &amp; Yellow, was able to create diversity, and thus sue in federal court, simply by changing its state of incorporation from KY to TN (and by joining the L&amp;NRR as a co-defendant, rather than a co-plaintiff, which might have seemed more logical).</li>
      <li>The diversity jurisdiction statute now defines the citizenship of a corporation as both its state of incorporation and the state where its principle place of business is located. So the plaintiff’s ruse in <em>Black &amp; White Taxi</em> would no longer work (because Brown &amp; Yellow was based in Kentucky).</li>
      <li>But this does not solve the larger problem under <em>Swift</em> of inconsistent outcomes between state and federal courts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="legal-positivism">Legal Positivism</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky but the articulate voice of some sovereign or quasi-sovereign that can be identified;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Southern Pac. Co. v. Jensen,</em> 244 US 205, 222 (1917) (Holmes, J. dissenting)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is very hard to resist the impression that there is one august corpus, to understand which clearly is the only task of any Court concerned. If there were such a transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute, the Courts of the United States might be right in using their independent judgment as to what it was. But there is no such body of law. The fallacy and illusion that I think exist consist in supposing that there is this outside thing to be found. Law is a word used with different meanings, but law in the sense in which courts speak of it today does not exist without some definite authority behind it. The common law so far as it is enforced in a State, whether called common law or not, is not the common law generally but the law of that State existing by the authority of that State without regard to what it may have been in England or anywhere else. It may be adopted by statute in place of another system previously in force. But a general adoption of it does not prevent the State Courts from refusing to follow the English decisions upon a matter where the local conditions are different. It may be changed by statute, as is done every day. It may be departed from deliberately by judicial decisions, as with regard to water rights, in States where the common law generally prevails.… Whether and how far and in what sense a rule shall be adopted whether called common law or Kentucky law is for the State alone to decide.</p>

<h5 id="issue-1">Issue</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Substantive issue: What duty of care Erie owed to Tompkins.
    <ul>
      <li>Erie: Under PA law, as declared in decisions of the PA Supreme Court, Tompkins was a trespasser to whom Erie was not liable.</li>
      <li>Tompkins: Under <em>Swift,</em> the federal court is not bound by PA state court decisions and under the general common law, Erie was liable for negligence.
        <ul>
          <li>Tompkins also disputed that the PA Supreme Court actually supported Erie’s position.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Brandeis opinion:
    <ul>
      <li>Legislative history of RDA
        <ul>
          <li>Early draft specified both “statute law” and “unwritten or common law”</li>
          <li>Story’s interpretation in <em>Swift</em> (limited to statutes and established local usages) was wrong</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perverse/undesirable consequences of <em>Swift</em>:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Taxicab</em> case as example
            <ul>
              <li><em>Swift</em> encourages forum shopping as between state and federal court.</li>
              <li><em>Swift</em> discriminates against parties unable to choose federal court.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Result is lack of uniformity, not the uniformity that supposedly justified the <em>Swift</em> rule</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Constitutional concern
        <ul>
          <li>Problem is not the RDA itself, but the Court’s interpretation of the RDA in <em>Swift</em></li>
          <li>Nothing in the Constitution gives federal courts the authority to come up with their own common law rules in areas of law that the Constitution leaves to the states</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Positivism provides the way out
        <ul>
          <li>If all law is only the law of a particular sovereign, then the distinction between common law and statute, and the notion of “general” common law, makes no sense</li>
          <li>The RDA must mean a federal court is supposed to apply some particular state’s law, regardless of whether it is state common law or state statute.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Whether, in an equity suit, a federal court must apply state statute of limitations if forum state’s courts would do so</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding--rationale">Holding &amp; Rationale</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Where forum state’s court would apply SOL to bar equitable remedy, federal court must do likewise
    <ul>
      <li>Effect of SOL is that party no longer has any claim for which a court may grant relief.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Erie does not turn on whether state courts characterize a state-law rule as “Substance” or “Procedure”
    <ul>
      <li>Pragmatic distinction
        <ul>
          <li>“Substantive” = “significantly affect the result of a litigation”

      <li>“[A] federal court adjudicating a state-created right solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties is for that purpose, in effect, only another court of the State”</li>
      <li>Therefore, federal court “cannot afford recovery if the right to recover is made unavailable by the State nor can it substantially affect the enforcement of the right as given by the State”</li>

  <li>The appropriate inquiry (whether under the RDA or the REA) is whether the choice of law “substantially affect those primary decisions respecting human conduct which our constitutional system leaves to state regulation”?

      <li>Interest in predictability: Allow parties to make decisions on how to act, based on understanding of the legal consequences.</li>

  <li>Majority’s REA test effectively means no Federal Rule will ever be found lacking

<h1 id="horizontal-choice-of-law-state-v-state">Horizontal Choice of Law: State v. State</h1>

<h2 id="choice-of-law-rules">Choice of Law Rules</h2>

<p>Various approaches to resolving choice of law questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Contacts test:</em> Apply the law of the state with which the parties have the most significant relevant contacts
    <ul>
      <li>Considers each party’s contacts with the various states whose law might apply. Cf. Minimum contacts test (personal jurisdiction): Considers only the <em>defendant’s</em> contacts with the <em>forum state</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Relationship test:</em> Apply the law of the state with the most significiant connection to the parties’ relationship giving rise to the claim.</li>
  <li><em>Balance of interests test:</em> Apply the law of the state with the greatest interest in the matter.
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on the policy behind each state’s law (which rights and parties does the state law aim to protect) and whether the state has an interest in its law being applied in the particular case.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Comparative impairment test:</em> Apply the law of the state whose interest would be most impaired if it’s law does not apply.
    <ul>
      <li>Analysis is similar to “balance of interests”, but takes a different approach to deciding which state’s interests to favor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding a choice of law issue, a court always follows its own state’s own choice of law approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Otherwise, how would you ever decide which choice of law rules to choose?</li>
  <li>Choice of law rules are “substantive” in the <em>Erie</em> sense, because the choice of which state’s (substantive) law to apply determines the rights &amp; obligations of the parties. So federal courts in diversity cases must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state. <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co.</em> (US 1941)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contractual-choice-of-law">Contractual Choice of Law</h2>

<p>A contractual choice of law clause specifies which state’s (or country’s) law will govern disputes between the parties. In effect, this is a shorthand way of including terms that the parties might otherwise have spelled out in the contract. <em>See</em> Restatement (2nd) of Conflicts of Law, § 187(1)</p>

<h2 id="restatement-2d-of-conflicts-of-law">Restatement (2d) of Conflicts of Law</h2>

<p>NC courts generally follow the Restatement approach, which combines aspects of the “contacts”, “relationship”, and “balance of interests” tests.</p>

<h3 id="torts">Torts</h3>

<h4 id="restatement--145">Restatement § 145</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The General Principle</p>

  <p>(1) The rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in § 6.</p>

  <p>(2) Contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of § 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) the place where the injury occurred,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="contracts">Contracts</h3>

<h4 id="restatement--187">Restatement § 187</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Law Of The State Chosen By The Parties</p>

  <p>(1) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue.</p>

  <p>(2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied, even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue, unless either</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’ choice, or</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which, under the rule of § 188, would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>(3) In the absence of a contrary indication of intention, the reference is to the local law of the state of the chosen law.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="restatement--188">Restatement § 188</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Law Governing In Absence Of Effective Choice By The Parties</p>

  <p>(1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in § 6.</p>

  <p>(2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see § 187), the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of § 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) the place of contracting,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(b) the place of negotiation of the contract,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(c) the place of performance,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</p>

  <p>(3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in §§ 189-199 and 203.</p>
