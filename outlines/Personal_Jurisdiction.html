<h4 id="pennoyer-v-neff-us-1878">Pennoyer v. Neff (US 1878)</h4>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<p>Prior suit: Mitchell v. Neff (Oregon state court)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mitchell (Oregon resident) sued Neff (not Oregon resident) to collect unpaid attorney’s fees
    <ul>
      <li>Service by publication in Oregon newspaper</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Court entered default judgment against Neff, who failed to appear
    <ul>
      <li>Mitchell satisfied judgment by attachment and execution on Neff’s Oregon property</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This suit: Neff v. Pennoyer (Oregon federal court)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neff sued to recover property from Pennoyer, who bought the property at sheriff’s sale
    <ul>
      <li>Trial court ruled in favor of Neff, based on defects in affidavit of service by publication in the prior case</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supreme Court affirmed
    <ul>
      <li>Defects in affidavit of service may only be challenged on direct appeal, not collateral attack</li>
      <li>But default judgment was void because the Oregon court lacked personal jurisdiction over Neff</li>
      <li>Absent a valid judgment, the attachment and sale of the property was also void</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding">Holding</h5>

<p>In personam judgment against non-resident defendant is void, where defendant was not personally served within state</p>

<ul>
  <li>In an in personam action to establish and enforce private rights, service of process on a non-resident defendant by publication is ineffective to establish personal jurisdiction</li>
  <li>The only proper means for bringing a non-resident defendant within the court’s jurisdiction are (1) personal service on the defendant while present in the state, or (2) the defendant’s voluntary appearance</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant, an in personam judgment against that defendant is void (n.b. not voidable)</p>

<h5 id="rationaletheory">Rationale/Theory</h5>

<p>Formalist theory of state sovereignty</p>

<ul>
  <li>State has jurisdiction over all persons and property within its territory</li>
  <li>No state has any jurisdiction over persons or property outside its territory</li>
  <li>This is a rule, rather than a standard
    <ul>
      <li>Simple binary choice: is the defendant physically present in the state or not?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Formalism”: Rests on a formality of physical presence</li>
</ul>

<p>Court recognizes exceptions to the physical presence requirement</p>

<ul>
  <li>In rem and quasi in rem actions
    <ul>
      <li>Because the state has jurisdiction over the in-state property</li>
      <li>But jurisdiction over the property must be established (by attachment) at the outset of the action, not after the fact</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mandated appointment of in-state agent
    <ul>
      <li>Non-residents entering into partnerships or associations</li>
      <li>Out-of-state corporations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="questions">Questions</h5>

<p>If Mitchell had personally served Neff in California (where Neff lived), would that have been effective? Why?</p>

<p>Was there any way Mitchell could have sued in Oregon?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attachment of property at outset of suit
    <ul>
      <li>Isn’t this an empty formalism?</li>
      <li>Isn’t a judgment against the property really a judgment against Neff?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Was there any other way to sue Neff in Oregon?</p>

<ul>
  <li>If not, what could Mitchell have done?</li>
  <li>Does that make sense?</li>

<h4 id="problems">Problems</h4>

<p>LeMond (resident of MN) &amp; Stanko (resident of PA) enter into contract for Stanko to represent LeMond in arranging sponsorship deals. A dispute arises between Stanko &amp; LeMond. Stanko files suit in PA, but does not serve LeMond. Stanko suggests that the parties meet at his office in PA to attempt to reach a settlement. LeMond does not attend, but sends his father, Robert. When Robert arrives, he is served with summons directed to Greg.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assuming that Robert is Greg’s agent for purposes of service, is jurisdiction proper? See <em>Stanko v. LeMond</em> (ED Pa. 1991)</li>

<p>While on a non-stop flight from NY to Hawaii, Defendant’s plane is grounded in California because of a storm. While Defendant is waiting in the airport, he is served with a summons for a suit in CA.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is this sufficient to confer jurisdiction?</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose the plane is not grounded. As the plane passes over California on the way to Hawaii, a process server aboard the plane hands Defendant a summons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is this sufficient to confer jurisdiction? See <em>Grace v. MacArthur</em> (ED Ark. 1959)</li>

<h2 id="express-consent">Express Consent</h2>

<h4 id="kane-v-new-jersey-us-1916">Kane v. New Jersey (US 1916)</h4>

<p>State law requires that out-of-state motorists expressly designate an in-state agent for service of process as a condition of using the state’s roads</p>

<p>In a suit over an accident that occurred while the non-resident was driving in the state, service on the in-state agent is sufficient to confer jurisdiction over the out-of-state defendant.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why may the state impose this requirement?</li>
  <li>Does it satisfy Due Process?</li>
  <li>How is this consistent with the formalist approach of Pennoyer?
    <ul>
      <li>“Virtual presence” through the in-state agent</li>

<p>Out-of-state motorist’s use of state’s roads implies appointment of a state official as the non-resident’s in-state agent for service</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does this satisfy Due Process?</li>
  <li>How is it consistent with the formalist approach of Pennoyer?</li>
  <li>Still relies on legal fiction of “virtual presence” through the in-state agent</li>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history-1">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<p>CBG (a DE corporation based in Guinea) sued multiple insurance carriers including ICI (incorporated &amp; based in Ireland) in PA federal court. Suit involved dispute over insurance coverage.</p>

<p>ICI &amp; other foreign defendants asserted lack of personal jurisdiction as a defense. CBG served discovery requests seeking documents pertaining to foreign defendants’ activities in PA, for purpose of establishing jurisdiction. After defendants repeated failure to produce the documents, the trial court imposed discovery sanctions under FRCP Rule 37(b). Sanctions included an order, pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(A), that “for the purposes of this litigation the [foreign defendants] are subject to the in personam jurisdiction of this Court due to their business contacts with Pennsylvania”.</p>

<p>Foreign defendants appealed, arguing that the discovery sanction was improper because the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants in the first place.</p>

<h5 id="holding-1">Holding</h5>

<p>By making a special appearance to contest jurisdiction (instead of refusing to appear and risking a default judgment), the defendants submitted to the court’s jurisdiction for that purpose and is bound by the court’s determination of that issue.</p>

<p>The court’s imposition of sanctions, including a determination that the facts supporting jurisdiction were established, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>

<h5 id="rationale-1">Rationale</h5>

<p>The requirement of personal jurisdiction is not a limit on the court’s sovereignty (which the parties cannot waive) but an individual right that can be waived</p>

<p>A defendant’s conduct may constitute implied consent to jurisdiction, or may result in the defendant’s being estopped from contesting jurisdiction
	- This may include the defendant’s failure to comply with procedural rules</p>

<p>Suppose that Dowell, a resident of Oregon, has an unrelated claim against Neff for breach of contract.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does Neff’s (implied) consent to personal jurisdiction in his suit against Mitchell also give an Oregon court personal jurisdiction over Neff in Dowell’s suit?</li>

<h4 id="international-shoe-v-washington-us-1945">International Shoe v. Washington (US 1945)</h4>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history-2">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<p>Missouri corporation sold shoes through sales representatives in Washington.</p>

<p>Sales representatives received orders from customers and transmitted them to company for acceptance in Missouri. The company fulfilled orders &amp; shipping them FOB from Missouri.</p>

<p>Washington sought to collect unemployment insurance tax from company for Washington-based sales representatives.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Company argued sales reps were independent contractors, not employees, and thus not covered by unemployment compensation.</li>
  <li>Agency concluded sales representatives were employees and assessed tax.</li>
</ul>

<p>Company appealed, arguing it was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Washington because it lacked any physical presence there</p>

<ul>
  <li>Company also argued service on sales representatives was ineffective, because they were not company’s agents for that purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding--analysis">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<p>Due process is satisfied where non-resident defendant has “minimum contacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’”</p>

<h5 id="contacts">Contacts</h5>

<p>Activity by the defendant, conducted within or directed at the forum state.</p>

<p>Nature &amp; quality of contacts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Systematic &amp; Continuous v. Irregular or Casual</li>
  <li>Give rise to claim v. unrelated to claim</li>
</ul>

<p>“[T]]o the extent that a corporation exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of that state”</p>

<p>Company’s in-state activity, through it’s sales employees, was sufficient to satisfy minimum contacts requirement
	- Case arose out of that activity</p>

<p>Service of process on company’s in-state employees (agents), whose in-state activities constitute company’s “presence”, is sufficient to provide notice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mailing of complaint &amp; summons to corporation’s out-of-state office is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hanson-v-denckla-us-1958">Hanson v. Denckla (US 1958)</h4>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history-3">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<p>Donner, a Pennsylvania resident, established a trust, naming a Delaware bank as trustee.</p>

<p>After Donner moved to Florida, she executed a power of appointment transferring $400k from the trust to two other trusts that her daughter, Hanson, had established for the benefit of her sons (Donner’s grandsons). Another Delaware bank was the trustee for these trusts.</p>

<p>Donner also executed a will, naming Hanson as executor, and directed that the balance of the original trust ($1 million) would pass under the will.</p>

<p>Donner’s two other daughters, Denckla &amp; Stewart, were the residual beneficiaries under the will. They contested the validity of the appointment granting $400k from the Donner trust to the two Hanson trusts, contending that this money should also pass to them under the will.</p>

<p>Denckla &amp; Stewart filed a declaratory judgment action in Florida court against Hanson and the two Delaware banks, to determine the status of the disputed trust funds</p>

<ul>
  <li>The banks were served by mail to their Delaware offices.</li>
  <li>Plaintiffs were required to include the banks as defendants, because they had actual control over trust assets. See FRCP Rule 19.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hanson and her sons moved to dismiss on the grounds that the Banks were not validly served and could not properly be joined because the Florida court lacked personal jurisdiction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If court lacks jurisdiction over an “indispensable” party, the court must usually dismiss the entire action. FRCP Rule 19</li>
</ul>

<p>The Florida court agreed that it lacked jurisdiction over the Delaware banks, but held that the appointment was invalid under Florida law and that the disputed funds should pass under the will.</p>

<p>While the Florida action was pending, Hanson filed a declaratory judgment action in Delaware state court.</p>

<p>After the Florida court issued its ruling, Denckla &amp; Stewart argued that the Florida judgment was binding on the Delaware court as res judicata. The Delaware court ruled that the appointment was valid under Delaware law and that the disputed funds belonged to the two Hanson trusts.</p>

<p>The Florida case was appealed to the Florida supreme court, which affirmed the lower court’s judgment on the merits, and further held that the Florida court had jurisdiction over the Delaware banks.</p>

<h5 id="holding--analysis-1">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<p>Florida court lacked jurisdiction over Delaware banks, and its judgment was therefore not entitled to full faith and credit, where Delaware banks did not have minimum contacts with Florida.</p>

<p>Minimum contacts must be based on “acts by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State”. Unilateral acts of other persons alone do not suffice</p>

<ul>
  <li>But do acts of other parties count at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>Trustee’s mere continuation of business with settler, after she moved from PA to FL, was not sufficient to constitute minimum contacts with FL</p>

<h5 id="question">Question</h5>

<h4 id="mcgee-v-international-life-ins-co-us-1957">McGee v. International Life Ins. Co. (US 1957)</h4>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history-4">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<p>McGee sued International Life, a Texas corporation, in California state court over its refusal to pay benefits under a life insurance policy. The policy was issued by Empire Mutual, an Arizona corporation, which sold the policy to Franklin, a California resident.</p>

<p>International acquired Empire Mutual and assumed its obligations under the policy. Neither Empire nor International solicited any other business or sold any other policies in California.</p>

<p>California statute gave jurisdiction over foreign insurance corporations in suits over insurance contracts with in-state residents</p>

<p>McGee served International by mail at its Texas office. International did not respond nor appear in California court and California court entered a default judgment in favor of McGee.</p>

<p>McGee sought to enforce her California judgment in Texas, but the Texas court refused to honor the California judgment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the Full and credit clause, the courts of one state must normally honor judgments rendered by the courts of other states.</li>
  <li>Exception: Where other state’s judgment was invalid because the court lacked jurisdiction or otherwise deprived the defendant of due process.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding--analysis-2">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<p>Jurisdiction in California was proper where Empire solicited the policy in California and International continued to accept payment from the California policy holder.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compare <em>Hanson</em>, where Delaware bank itself did nothing to initiate contact with Florida</li>
</ul>

<p>Balance the burden on defendant v. interest of state</p>

<ul>
  <li>Court considers state’s interest in providing remedy for its residents as a factor in deciding whether exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process</li>

<ul>
  <li>Keeton sued in NH because the statute of limitations had run in other states.</li>

<p>Jurisdiction in California proper where effects of defendants’ conduct were felt in CA</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enquirer sold many copies in CA</li>
  <li>Defendants knew Jones lived and worked in CA, and reached out to her there in preparing the story</li>
  <li>Conduct was thus “expressly aimed” at CA</li>

<h5 id="facts--procedural-history-8">Facts &amp; Procedural History</h5>

<p>Gray was injured when a water heater, manufactured by American Radiator (IL), exploded. Explosion was caused by valve manufactured by Titan (Ohio).</p>

<p>Gray sued American Radiator &amp; Titan in Illinois, and served Titan by mail in Ohio.</p>

<p>Titan moved to dismiss on two grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Illinois long-arm statute, providing for jurisdiction over out-of-state defendant who commits a tortuous act within the state, did not apply where Titan’s conduct was entirely outside the state.</li>
  <li>Even if Illinois long-arm statute applied, exercise of jurisdiction violated 14th Amendment due process</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding--analysis-6">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<p><em>Statutory interpretation</em></p>

<p>Illinois long-arm statute conferred jurisdiction against a defendant who “commits a tortuous act within this State”. The place of injury (IL), not the place of defendant’s last act (manufacture &amp; sale of valve outside IL), is the place where the tortuous act occurred.</p>

<p><em>Due Process/Minimum Contacts</em></p>

<p>“Where the business done by a foreign corporation in the State of the forum is of a sufficiently substantial nature, it has been held permissible for the State to entertain a suit against it even though the cause of action arose from activities entirely distinct from its conduct within the State. But where such business or other activity is not substantial, the particular act or transaction having no connection with the State of the forum, the requirement of ‘contact’ is not satisfied.” 176 NE2d at 438 (Citations omitted)</p>

<p>Single act/transaction within forum state may suffice, if it is basis of suit</p>

<p>Court assumes other appliances with Titan valves were sold in IL.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Titan benefits, at least indirectly, from protection of Illinois, which facilitates sales of Titan’s goods in that state.</li>
  <li>Legal realism: Court bases analysis on the realities of the interstate supply chain/stream of commerce</li>

<p>Residents of Argentina sued Daimler in California federal court, alleging that Daimler’s Argentinian subsidiary collaborated with government security forces during Argentina’s “dirty war”. Plaintiffs were victims, or family members of victims, of government human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Daimler, incorporated and based in Germany, moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs argued that Daimler was subject to jurisdiction in California based on the California contacts of its US subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz USA, incorporated in Delaware and based in New Jersey. District Court granted Daimler’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Court of Appeals reversed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Court assumed that MBUSA was subject to “general jurisdiction” in California, based on its regular distribution of vehicles to authorized dealers in California.</li>
  <li>Daimler is subject to jurisdiction in California based on the activity of its agent, MBUSA.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="holding--anlaysis">Holding &amp; Anlaysis</h5>

<p>No personal jurisdiction over Daimler in California in suit for injuries that occurred, and were cause by conduct occurring, outside the US.</p>

<p>General jurisdiction (i.e. in a case not arising from in-state contacts) requires more than “continuous and systematic” contacts with the forum state. The defendant must be “essentially at home in the forum state” (quoting <em>Goodyear</em>).</p>

<p>Neither Daimler nor MBUSA was incorporated or based in California, and their California activity was insufficient to make them “virtually at home” there.</p>

<p>Activity giving rise to claims occurred entirely outside California and had no direct impact there.</p>

<p>While Harris was traveling in MD, Epstein brought <em>quasi in rem</em> action, attaching Harris’s debt to Balk, to satisfy Balk’s debt to Epstein. MD court ordered Harris to pay Epstein instead of Balk.</p>

<p>Balk later sued Harris in NC to collect on Harris’s debt to Balk. Harris argued NC court must give full faith and credit to MD judgment, and his payment to Epstein pursuant to that order discharged his debt to Balk. Balk argued MD judgment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Whether attachment of Balk’s property (i.e. debt owed by Harris) located in MD was sufficient to establish quasi in rem jurisdiction over Balk</p>

<h5 id="holding--analysis-9">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<p>Maryland court’s exercise of <em>quasi in rem</em> jurisdiction, as authorized by Maryland law, satisfied due process, and judgment was valid.</p>

<p>A debt represents property of creditor. The debt is located wherever debtor is present.</p>

<p>Harris is bound by MD judgment, because he was personally served while in MD.</p>

<p>Attachment of Balk’s property in MD is sufficient to satisfy due process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Balk could have sued Harris in MD to collect on his debt, or (pursuant to MD law in attachment cases) brought an action in MD within a year after the judgment, seeking restitution from Epstein.</li>
  <li>Court notes that the outcome would have been different if Harris had been negligent in failing to give Balk notice of the MD court’s attachment of the debt.

<p>Suit alleged directors breached their fiduciary duty by approving activity that resulted in civil and criminal antitrust liability that resulted in civil and criminal antitrust liability. Activity at issue occurred in Oregon.</p>

<p>DE law provided for “sequestration” of non-resident defendant’s in-state property as means to obtain jurisdiction. If defendant appears &amp; consents to jurisdiction, sequestration is released.</p>

<p>Defendant directors owned shares of Greyhound stock. Under DE law, shares of DE corporation were “located” in Delaware.</p>

<p>Heitner served directors by mail to their out-of-state addresses and publication in Delaware newspaper (per DE law).</p>

<p>Defendants argued the DE court lacked personal jurisdiction because they had no minimum contacts with DE. The DE court held sequestration was sufficient to establish quasi in rem jurisdiction.</p>

<h5 id="holding--analysis-10">Holding &amp; Analysis</h5>

<p>“Minimum Contacts” standard applies to <em>quasi in rem</em> jurisdiction</p>

<p>Where property is unrelated to cause of action, defendants must have other contacts with forum state to support jurisdiction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where property is related to cause of action, will minimum contacts ever not be satisfied?</li>
</ul>

<p>Court noted that Delaware law was unusual in treating shares as located in state of incorporation, rather than shareholder’s state of residence. Mere ownership of shares is not enough to satisfy minimum contacts, where the “location” of that property in the state is a matter of legal formality, not any act or decision by defendants.</p>

<p>“Necessity” exception (dicta)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where no other forum is available, <em>quasi in rem</em> jurisdiction (Type IIb) may be permissible even absent other contacts.</li>

  <li>Interest in property located in forum state is a sufficient contact</li>
  <li>Cause of action arises out of that property</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Quasi in rem II(b)</em></p>

<p>Assuming property is defendant’s only contact with the forum state, satisfaction of minimum contacts standard depends on relationship between property and cause of action</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where cause of action arises out of property, standard will generally be satisfied. This is essentially a hybrid of <em>Quasi in rem</em> II(a) and II(b).</li>
  <li>Where property unrelated the cause of action, it will not be sufficient on its own to satisfy the minimum contacts standard.
    <ul>
      <li>But location of property in the state, along with other contacts, may satisfy the standard.</li>
